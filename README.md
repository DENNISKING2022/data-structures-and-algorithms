# Data Structures and Algorithms
Understanding data structures and algorithms is important for a developer because it can help us write more efficient and effective code. Data structures provide a way to store and organize data in a way that enables efficient access and modification, while algorithms provide a set of steps for performing operations on data. By understanding how to use different data structures and algorithms, developers can choose the best tools for the job and write code that scales well and performs optimally. This is especially important for applications that handle large amounts of data or require real-time processing, such as search engines, social networks, and e-commerce platforms. In short, understanding data structures and algorithms can help developers write code that is both functional and efficient.

# Data Structures
[Array](src/Data structures)
<li> The time complexity for the basic operations of an array data structure, such as accessing an element, inserting an element, and deleting an element, is generally constant time, O(1). This means that the time it takes to perform these operations does not depend on the size of the array.
The space complexity of an array is O(n), where n is the number of elements in the array. This means that the space required to store the array increases linearly with the number of elements in the array.
