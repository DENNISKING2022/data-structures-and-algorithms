# Data Structures and Algorithms
Understanding data structures and algorithms is important for a developer because it can help us write more efficient and effective code. Data structures provide a way to store and organize data in a way that enables efficient access and modification, while algorithms provide a set of steps for performing operations on data. By understanding how to use different data structures and algorithms, developers can choose the best tools for the job and write code that scales well and performs optimally. This is especially important for applications that handle large amounts of data or require real-time processing, such as search engines, social networks, and e-commerce platforms. In short, understanding data structures and algorithms can help developers write code that is both functional and efficient.

# Data Structures
[Array](src/Data-Structures/Array.java)
<li> The time complexity for the basic operations of an array data structure, such as accessing an element, inserting an element, and deleting an element, is generally constant time, O(1). This means that the time it takes to perform these operations does not depend on the size of the array.
The space complexity of an array is O(n), where n is the number of elements in the array. This means that the space required to store the array increases linearly with the number of elements in the array.

[BinaryTree](src/Data-Structures/BinaryTree.java)
<li> The time complexity for the basic operations of a binary tree data structure, such as searching for a value, inserting a value, and deleting a value, is generally O(log n), where n is the number of nodes in the tree. The space complexity of a binary tree is also O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the tree.

[DoublyLinkedList](src/Data-Structures/DoublyLinkedList.java)
<li> The time complexity for the basic operations of a doubly linked list data structure, such as searching for a value, inserting a value, and deleting a value, is generally O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the list. The space complexity of a doubly linked list is also O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the list.

[HashTable](src/Data-Structures/HashTable.java)
<li> The time complexity for the basic operations of a hash table data structure, such as searching for a value, inserting a value, and deleting a value, is generally O(1), on average. The space complexity of a hash table is also O(n), where n is the number of elements in the table.

[LinkedList](src/Data-Structures/LinkedList.java)
<li> The time complexity for the basic operations of a singly linked list data structure, such as searching for a value, inserting a value, and deleting a value, is generally O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the list. This means that the time it takes to perform these operations increases linearly with the number of nodes in the list.
The space complexity of a singly linked list is also O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the list. This means that the space required to store the list increases linearly with the number of nodes in the list.

[Sets](src/Data-Structures/Sets.java)
<li> The time complexity for the basic operations of a set data structure, such as searching for a value, inserting a value, and deleting a value, is generally O(log n), on average. The space complexity of a set is also O(n), where n is the number of elements in the set.

[Stacks](src/Data-Structures/Stacks.java)
<li> The time complexity for the basic operations of a stack data structure, such as pushing and popping elements, is generally O(1), on average. The space complexity of a stack is also O(n), where n is the number of elements in the stack. 

# Search Algorithms
[BinarySearch](src/Search-Algorithms/BinarySearch.java)
<li> The time complexity of a binary search algorithm is O(log n), where n is the number of elements in the array or list being searched. The space complexity is O(1), as it only requires a constant amount of memory to store variables such as the left and right pointers and the middle element.

[DepthFirstSearch](src/Search-Algorithms/DepthFirstSearch.java)
<li> When working with tree data structures, the time complexity of a depth-first search (DFS) algorithm is O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the tree. This is because, in the worst case, the algorithm visits all the nodes in the tree. 

[LinearSearch](src/Search-Algorithms/LinearSearch.java)
<li> The time complexity of a linear search algorithm, also known as sequential search, is O(n), where n is the number of elements in the array or list being searched. The space complexity of a linear search algorithm is O(1), as it only requires a constant amount of memory to store variables such as the current element being searched and the index of the desired element.
